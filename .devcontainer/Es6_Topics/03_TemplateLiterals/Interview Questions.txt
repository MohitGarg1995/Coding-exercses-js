Template Literals
What’s the difference between using + for string concatenation and using template literals?

How do template literals handle multi‑line strings compared to normal strings?

Can you use expressions inside template literals? Show an example.

In React, where would you prefer template literals over concatenation? Give a practical example.

What happens if you use backticks but forget ${} around a variable?

Answers----------------------------

1. Difference between + concatenation and template literals
   Concatenation: "Hello " + name + "!"
   Template literals: `Hello ${name}!` 👉 Template literals are cleaner,
   support multi‑line strings, and allow embedded expressions.

2. Multi‑line strings
    Normal strings need \n: "Line1\nLine2"
    Template literals allow natural multi‑line:
    eg:- const msg = `Line1
    Line2`;

3. Expressions inside template literals
    const a = 5, b = 10;
    console.log(`Sum is ${a + b}`);

4. React use case
    <div className={`card ${isActive ? "active" : ""}`}></div>

5. Forgetting ${}
    const name = "Mohit";
    console.log(`Hello name`);
