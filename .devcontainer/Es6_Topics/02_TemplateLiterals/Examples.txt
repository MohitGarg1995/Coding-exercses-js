Perfect — let’s make this super practical. I’ll show you **tiny examples** for each case (dynamic objects, API responses, query parameters, form data, props objects) so you see where template literals naturally fit into React workflows.  

---

## 🔹 **1. Dynamic Objects**
React often stores data in objects. Template literals help you display values easily.

```js
const user = { name: "Mohit", role: "Developer" };

console.log(`User ${user.name} is a ${user.role}`);
```

👉 Output:  
`User Mohit is a Developer`

---

## 🔹 **2. API Responses**
When you fetch data, you often need to format it for display.

```js
const product = { title: "Laptop", price: 45000 };

console.log(`Product: ${product.title}, Price: ₹${product.price}`);
```

👉 Output:  
`Product: Laptop, Price: ₹45000`

---

## 🔹 **3. Query Parameters**
Building dynamic URLs for API calls is a daily React task.

```js
const baseURL = "https://api.example.com";
const endpoint = "search";
const query = "react";

console.log(`${baseURL}/${endpoint}?q=${query}`);
```

👉 Output:  
`https://api.example.com/search?q=react`

---

## 🔹 **4. Form Data**
When handling forms, you often need to show a summary.

```js
const formData = { name: "Riya", email: "riya@example.com" };

console.log(`Form submitted by ${formData.name} with email ${formData.email}`);
```

👉 Output:  
`Form submitted by Riya with email riya@example.com`

---

## 🔹 **5. Props Objects (React‑specific)**
Props are just objects passed into components. Template literals help render them.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h2>{`Hello ${props.name}, you are ${props.age} years old!`}</h2>;
}

// Usage
<Welcome name="Mohit" age={28} />
```

👉 Rendered Output:  
`Hello Mohit, you are 28 years old!`

# ✅ Where else can you use template literals in React?
- **Dynamic class names**:  
  ```jsx
  <div className={`card ${isActive ? "active" : ""}`}></div>
  ```
- **Inline styles**:  
  ```jsx
  <div style={{ backgroundColor: `${themeColor}` }}>Hello</div>
  ```
- **Logging debug info**:  
  ```js
  console.log(`Component ${componentName} mounted at ${Date.now()}`);
  ```

⚡ So template literals are like your **Swiss army knife** in React — they make string building clean, readable, and dynamic.

Would you like me to give you a **mini React project example** (like a search bar that builds a query string using template literals) so you can practice this in a real React component?
